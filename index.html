        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Joseph and in this section I'm going to talk a little about myself. 
        First I want to talk about my hobbies. My favourite sport is basketball and I play this sport 
        a lot. In grade 10, I was on the school team, which was a very nice experience. 
        I don't only like to play it, but enjoy watching it as well. I enjoy watching NBA games and 
        watching the players play, and I would say that one of my favourite players is Trae Young. 
        I personally don't have a main favourite, but I really like Trae Young’s playing style, as he 
        is a quick player who can shoot and dribble the ball very well. I also like to play a video 
        game called NBA 2K, which is a game that consists of basketball. I get to play online with 
        my friends which is fun. Basketball is not the only thing I like, as I love to listen to music 
        as well.

    <div id="travisscotttext">
        <p>The main genre of music I listen to is rap music, but sometimes I listen to RnB. One 
        of my favourite rappers is Travis Scott just because of the energy he gives off. I like his 
        personality and how he sees life when it comes toward enjoying it. He always says that he hates 
        bystanders at his concert because he wants everybody up and dancing and enjoying their time properly. This also goes for in general, in life when your at a party or a celebration, you shouldn't be standing or sitting around, but intead up and enjoying it. I also like 
        to watch shows and movies in my free time. One of my favourite shows is called “The Fresh Prince
        of Belair”, which is a really good series that I recommend watching. One of my favourite 
        subjects to take in school is math. In the future, I am hoping to get into a career in 
        engineering, as it is a field that interests me. This is a little about me, the things I 
        enjoy doing, and what I aspire to do in the future.
