                <h2>Techs That I'm Good At</h2>
                <p>This is my first time taking a computer science course and I am not familiar with coding or 
                 programming, but I am familiar with some tech. In grade 10, I took a tech design course that 
                showed me how to use different programs. I have a basic understanding of using photoshop, as well 
                as other adobe programs. I am not the most experienced with tech, as I still have much to learn, 
                but these are some of the things I have worked with. Thus, I would say that I have the most 
                experience in common operating systems.

                <h2>Techs I Want To Learn For The Future</h2>
                <p id="techforfuture">Knowing that I am a newcomer, I want to learn to use different types of tech in the future. 
                To begin with, I want to know more about programming languages and get more familiar with this. 
                With having this knowledge, I can learn how to set up instructions that produce various kinds of 
                output. Another type of tech I would like to learn is project managing. In the future, if there 
                are any electrical engineering projects, knowing how project management programs work can give me 
                the chance to lead the projects and manage them. Tech project management can give me an idea of 
                how project management will be like and I may be able to learn some important points about it. 
                Lastly, I am interested in learning about data analyst tech. This can also help me in the future 
                for when I am collecting data for a company so that I can analyze the data and explain it to the 
                company owners so they can understand it.

        <h2>Why This Course?</h2>
        <p>The reason that I am taking computer science is because I want to get an idea of using different 
        apps and programs when using a computer. This also gives me the opportunity to learn more about 
        coding and what it consists of. In the future, I plan on being an electrical engineer. One of 
        the main jobs of an electrical engineer is to develop new electrical systems, which is very 
        important. This means that I could be using online programs to make a map of an electrical 
        system. This is why it'd be helpful for me, as I may be using computers in my career later on 
        in life. The main reason is that I was interested in seeing what this course has to offer and 
         what knowledge it can give me for the future.
